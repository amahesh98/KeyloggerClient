# KeyloggerClient
This is a subdued keylogger that once clicked, will run until the computer shuts down. If the server is running, all keylogged data will be sent to the server.
The server address can be changed to a custom one in source/keylogger.py

To run the logger, simply double-click run. The rest is taken care of.
